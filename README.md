## H1Z1 King Of The Kill Subreddit CSS

Place to store the css for the KOTK subreddit while I uncrappify the layout and stuff of that nature.


Done
--------------
- Header style (Still need a new background image though)
- Added sexy flairs
- Fixed daybreak and other staff member flairs
- Changed post layout and style
- Submission buttons


Currently doing
--------------
- Creating flairs
- Modernizing sidebar
- Modernizing post form
- A bunch of other misc fixes to make sure it the style works on every screen resolution


Todo
--------------
- Re-order the CSS so it's in an order that makes sense.
